Driver inattention has long been recognized as the main contributing factor in traffic accidents. 
We attempt to develop an accurate and robust system for detecting distracteddrivers and warn hm against it.
Motivated by the performance of CNN in computer vision, we present a CNN based system that not only detects the distracted driver bur also identifies the cause of distraction.
The main idea is to monitor driver hand position with discriminative informatin extracted to predict safe/unsafe driving posture.
This project is a desktop application that can be used to give warnings to drivers if he's talking on the hone while driving.
To understand the driver behaviors,  a driver activities recognition system is designed based on the deep CNN wherein common driving activities are identified, which are normal driving, mirror checking, using in-vehicle radio devices, texting, and answering the mobile phone.
